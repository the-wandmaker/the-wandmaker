At times, I like to consider an imaginary authoritative figure; The Supreme Ubermagus Prime, who is of the 999th degree, and hails from a magical order so ancient that it bares no true name. The Ubermagus has been imparted with sum total of esoteric wisdom, and will thus convey the knowledge such that left is bad and right is good, certain days of the month are better for traveling, and that various symbols have specific meanings. For each claim the Ubermagus makes, I ask _why_? (to which, the Ubermagus in growing exasperation, eventually exclaims, _"You impertinent fool!"_ For how dare I question the teachings of the Ubermagus?)

A skill that I have found valuable while exploring various esoteric topics is to question all vague and strange notions. Where does a certain idea come from? Why do people believe a given claim to be true? Often, a long repeated phrase turns out to be backed by a conceptual structure that is more malleable than its derivatives. It is excellent to know the meaning of various symbols, but would it not be of more use to understand the systems by which those symbols were derived? With the latter, one has the skill set to create their own symbolic concepts and expand upon existing frameworks.

An environment of learning is a sacred space, one even an Ubermagus cannot deny the sanctity of. Outside of this space, society entrains us to fear to expose a gap in our own knowledge, it ascribes to that characteristic negative connotations of ignorance and weakness. But inside the circle, any good fool will soon realize there is a powerful and transformative force that can be harnessed by asking questions.

## Discussing the Impossible

When it comes to the vast array of esoteric concepts that exist, limits should never be imposed on the ability of someone to question a claim. Although it should be acknowledged that some inexplicable things truly cannot be explained, there should always be an avenue by which we can discuss _why_ something cannot be explained. If we can't discuss a topic, nor have others understand how a conclusion was reached, then there is likely missing or inaccurate information. Sustainable concepts may bend under the weight of relentless questioning, but poorly constructed ones will collapse entirely.

Popularly quoted on a rage of science-themed podcasts, is the Sagan standard, or that "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". This aphorism, while it does have its merits, encourages a conflation between _evidence_ and _explanation_, the difference being that an explanation may suffice with zero evidence and likewise be judged within the context that it is presented. Furthermore, the statement forces a claim into further quantification, ironic considering the Sagan standard has no quantitative criteria itself. When we place skepticism at the forefront of qualifying new ideas for further consideration we risk letting our own imagination guess the price of evidence that should be required to back the claim.

As a brief examination of economic effects, consider then that there is often a strict cost required to gather evidence, explanations on the other hand are only bounded by comprehension. There is a further implication here that economies will drive what we have evidence of, and that there is a bias to ignore ideas the originate in poorer communities. When we discuss the extraordinary and the impossible, it is imperative that we judge the concept in terms of the soundness of its explanation, the steep cost of extraordinary evidence can seldom be paid up front.

Any subject considered to be "esoteric" is, by its very nature, something which rests hidden in the shadows of conventional understanding. Economic logic rationalized the the status-quo to be maintained, so perhaps it will only ever be foolish who venture into the darkness wielding the light of inquiry.

## Examples

Here are a few fun examples for any other impertinent fools out there. I've tried to stick mostly to links and quotes for these, so you can dig deeper and don't need to take my word for it.

### Tibetan Singing Bowls

> Academic consensus is that the ‘Tibetan’ singing bowl is a thoroughly modern and Western invention, and that singing bowls are really not Tibetan at all.

> The objects often now referred to as 'Tibetan singing bowls', and marketed as Tibetan ritual instruments, have been called "dharma products" that in fact come from northern India or Nepal, and are neither Tibetan nor ritual in origin.

### Runic Divination Meanings

If you've ventured into any esoteric shop recently you've likely seen sets of runes etched on wood or stone and accompanied by a small book or pamphlet that describes how to cast them and what each rune means. But where did these meanings originate from?

> In 1982, a modern usage of the runes for answering life's questions was apparently originated by Ralph Blum in his divination book The Book of Runes: A Handbook for the Use of an Ancient Oracle, which was marketed with a small bag of round tiles with runes stamped on them. This book has remained in print since its first publication. The sources for Blum's divinatory interpretations, as he explained in The Book of Runes itself, drew heavily on then-current books describing the ancient I Ching divination system of China.

> ~ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runes

As it currently stands, there are limited historical accounts that describe the method by which runes were used for divination. The details of these practices were likely passed through oral tradition and have been lost to history. One of the more complete, yet still vague descriptions comes from the Roman historian and politician, Cornelius Tacitus.

> Their method of divining by lots is exceeding simple. From a
tree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small
pieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them
at random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the
community, if for the public the lots are consulted, or the father of
a family if about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the
Gods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and
having done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made.

> [Tacitus on Germany, Cornelius Tacitus](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2995)

> As a side note, the detail about fruit-bearing trees is one of the reasons that I like to work with woods like apple.

### Lucky Number 7

The significance of the number 7 is ancient, and has many counts attributed to it, but its positive association is likely astronomical in origin.

> ... for as the moon changes its phases every seven days, so this number influences all sublunary beings. The phrase "to be in the seventh heaven" was derived from the seven planets, which were believed by the Babylonians to be carried around upon as many globes of crystal, the seventh being the highest. In the writings of the Cabalists of old are likewise portrayed seven heavens, one above another, and the seventh or highest was the abode of God and the higher angels.
