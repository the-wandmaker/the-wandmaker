In Egyptian mythology, it was said that the heart of a person passing into the afterlife would be weighed by the goddess Ma'at against the feather of truth. A somewhat similar reference to truth exists in the phrase "the truth will set you free", a common quote that is actually an out of context bible verse (John 8:32). There is a general consensus in common language that asserts a certain lightness to truth and goodness, and a heaviness to lies and evil. A lengthy discussion could be dedicated to exploring why these associations exist, but starting a step back we might be able to see that in general it is information that seems to its own sort of mass.

Supposing that information does have "mass" (it certainly can have volume and density as most avid readers may be able to attest to), then it would also seem reasonable to assert that an equivalent to energy also exists for this metaphor. To me it would seem that questions ("quest" "ions"?) might represent a form of potential kinetic energy. Much like a compressed spring, they can be stored up and released at opportune moments. Questions are a force that can be highly destructive to information, breaking it down if it cannot withstand their bombardment. Weak ideas and various forms of misinformation often crumble under the force of a well placed question.
